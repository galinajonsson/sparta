  nsites = 20,
  nvisits = 100,
  nTP = 10,
  psi = 0.5,
  trend = -0.01,
  mu.lp = -1,

}
\arguments{
\item{nsites}{numeric, the number of sites from which the simulated data is sampled.}

\item{nvisits}{numeric, the number of visits from which the simulated data is sampled.}

\item{nTP}{numeric, the number of time periods from which the simulated data is sampled.}

\item{psi}{probability of a site being occupied in time period 1.}

\item{trend}{the proportion of sites that change state each time period.
For decreasing trends the probability of persistence from one time period to the next is 1 + the trend value.
Probability of colonisation is 0.
For increasing trends the probability of an unoccupied site being colonised from one time period to the next is the trend value.
Probability of persistence is 1.}

\item{mu.lp}{the mean value for the normal distribution for the year effect (alpha.p) on the observation model.}

\item{tau.lp}{the precision value for the normal distribution for the year effect (alpha.p) on the observation model.}

\item{beta1}{the mean value for the normal distribution for the effect of Julian day on observation model.This must be a valid Julian date}

\item{beta2}{the standard deviation for the normal distribution for the effect of Julian day on observation model.}

\item{beta3}{parameter on the logit scale governing the magnitude of the Julian date effect on the observation model.}

\item{dtype2.p}{parameter (logit scale) for list length 2-3 on the observation model.}

\item{dtype3.p}{parameter (logit scale) for list length 4 on the observation model.}

\item{JD_range}{range of Julian dates upon which visits can take place. If this is null Julian date ranges between 1 and 365.}
}
\value{
A list, the first two elements of which ('spp_vis' & 'occDetData') mimic the output of occDetFunc.
The third element ('Z') is the presence-absence state variable and the fourth ('p') is the true probability of detection.
}
\description{
Simulates some data suitable for use in sparta
The user defines the parameters for the data generation
At present it works with just one species and generates the list length probabalistically
